c3 = Composition.create(title: "Ether", forces: "for organ and live electronics", year: 2014, programme_note: " Ether explores both sound and the organ itself as physical and spatial objects. By amplifying the organ and processing the sound across a surround sound eight-channel system, the organ’s physicality is extended beyond the space it inhabits. While this approach may trivialise the musical content in some sense, reducing it to the larger entity of musical form, it does emphasize the spatial aspect of music, without which sound would fail to travel across rooms. This physicality of sound evokes the withdrawn nature of music; while it is unseen, it continues to traverse space whether coming from a single loudspeaker or thirty musicians.", streaming: %Q[<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/102578654?color=29e363&byline=0&portrait=0" width="750" height="422" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>], image: %Q[ether.jpg])
c4 = Composition.create(title: "Noumena", forces: "for orchestra", year: 2013, programme_note: "The title of this work refers to an object beyond our phenomenal experience of it. Throughout the piece, listeners are presented with two musical ideas: a cloud-like micropolyphony, and a collection of harmonically rich sustained chords. However, both ideas are defined by an absence; neither idea achieves a stable equilibrium with the other, and neither ever commands the full focus of the orchestra. Consequently, the two ideas are locked in an ever-evolving relationship: never in direct contact, yet always absorbed in each other’s existence. While negotiating space, the two ideas simultaneously reveal their hidden qualities while also hinting at a deeper world of activity underneath.", streaming: %Q[<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/77191264?color=29e363&byline=0&portrait=0" width="750" height="422" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>], image: %Q[noumena.jpg])

The ensemble slowly makes its way down the playing range of the quartet, beginning at extreme highs above the fingerboard. As the players descend, they begin to splinter from their strict unified origins, resulting in factions.

c6 = Composition.create(title: "Surfaces", forces: "for piano trio", year: 2013, programme_note: "In some ways, the piano trio is an awkward ensemble. While the group has a wide harmonic range available to it, it is limited in its timbre – not quite a choir, but more voices than a traditional counterpoint. As such, this work displays a number of densely populated harmonic fields articulated by a limited number of voices: the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a dark, rich and weird subterranean world underneath.", streaming: %Q[<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/114808693&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>], image: %Q[surfaces.jpg])

c9 = Composition.create(title: "Sirens", forces: "a sound installation", year: 2011, programme_note: " The primary concern of this sound based work is the space it inhabits. The space between the sliding doors of the Adam Art Gallery usually goes unnoticed. Its qualities are masked by its functionality as an entrance way. This work aims to draw visitors in and to entice them to take notice of their immediate surroundings, however momentary and seemingly incidental. As one walks through the speaker array, human voices replace the soft sine tones, and may follow them as they pass through. The space becomes a siren-like trap as the beauty of the harmony motivates them to stay. This may also make for a potentially uncomfortable experience.", streaming: %Q[<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/28925226?color=29e363&byline=0&portrait=0" width="750" height="422" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>], image: %Q[sirens.jpg])
c10 = Composition.create(title: "Shimmer", forces: "for string quartet", year: 2011, programme_note: " The title Shimmer specifically relates to the sound of the Javanese Gamelan gong ageng. The rich and powerful inharmonic spectrum of the gong provides both the pitch material and a loose form for the work. Over three movements, the act of hitting the gong is simulated - the strike, the compressed and rich beating of the gong shimmer, and finally the lasting resonance. Another influence is the mythology behind the gong, as a tool for communicating on a timeless and ethereal plane. The act of listening is certainly transcendental in that it can move us beyond our immediate temporal attention or draw us into an attention that ignores all notion of a temporal context.", streaming: %Q[<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=142468729/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://jasonpost.bandcamp.com/track/shimmer-2nd-3rd-movements">Shimmer (2nd &amp; 3rd Movements) by jason post</a></iframe>], image: %Q[shimmer.jpg])
